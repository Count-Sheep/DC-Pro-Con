# Disconnect your pro controllers
This is a simple Overlay file (.OVL) to use with Tesla which you can find here: https://github.com/WerWolv/Tesla-Menu
Put this .OVL on your SD Card in /Switch/.Overlays/ after installing Tesla Menu 
Put the themes into /Switch/Themes after installing NXThemes

If the Theme Crashes on boot, You can remove it by going into the /atmosphere/contents/0100000000001000/ and deleting every file in that folder.

## What?
This OVL will disconnect any bluetooth controller without having to enter the settings menu or remove the switch from the dock.

## Why?
This makes the use of Dock Lock's to deter theft actually usable as the switch forces it to be removed from the dock to disconnect. 

## Won't people still forget?
Yeah... I made a nice theme to go with this though to help with that. 

------------------

I'm not a programmer so i scraped by with making this function so please let me know of any issues.
